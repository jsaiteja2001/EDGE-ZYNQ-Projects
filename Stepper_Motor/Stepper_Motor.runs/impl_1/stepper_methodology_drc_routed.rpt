LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell W1_OBUF_inst_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) FSM_sequential_Ps_state_reg[0]/CLR, FSM_sequential_Ps_state_reg[1]/CLR, FSM_sequential_Ps_state_reg[2]/CLR, div_reg[0]/CLR, div_reg[10]/CLR, div_reg[11]/CLR, div_reg[12]/CLR, div_reg[13]/CLR, div_reg[14]/CLR, div_reg[15]/CLR, div_reg[1]/CLR, div_reg[2]/CLR, div_reg[3]/CLR, div_reg[4]/CLR, div_reg[5]/CLR (the first 15 of 19 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
